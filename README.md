# üòÅ About AG√ÅP√â

The Vision for Effect Node Metaverse is that everyone should be able to own a piece of the whole metaverse cake over the internet. LokLok, the sole inventor of EffectNode, wants to embrace the hyperlink in the internet because it‚Äôs the fundamental of the internet that is letting users flow to different information with a breeze.

3D Content on the web has always been a high price / high cost for anyone who wants to own a piece of the metaverse cake. And by sharing the starter boilerplate, it made the metaverse open and to prevent a single ownership of the technology.

We all don‚Äôt really like having to pay a royalty fee to every creation that we yearn to make.
